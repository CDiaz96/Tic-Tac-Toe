Tech used: HTML, CSS, Object Oriented Javascript

How It's Made: When creating this website I focused on making it functional first before I went in and applied the CSS. I created the basic layout on HTML and added the different cells that would contain the X's and O's. For this particular website multiple objects were created in order to run the functions.

Lessons Learned: Through this particular project I was able to learn how to condense my code by using object oriented programing.
